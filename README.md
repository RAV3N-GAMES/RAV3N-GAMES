# Now Working
 1. Need to decide the meaning of "Chane" in secrets.
  - Is there a secret-aim enemy even there's no secrets in the map?
  - What means "10" in balance.xls?
 2. Does the secret have an upgrade option?
 3. Are there some limits followed by player's fame?
  - The Player can use only 1 secret when his fame is under 9, can use 2 when is fame is under 14, ...
  - Need Gold?
